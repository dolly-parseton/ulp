## Overview
ULP is a continuation on an old project to create a scalable forensic analysis platform that utilises the speed of Rust and value of Elastic Searh as a mean of performing analysis.
The initial versions were very successful and completed this goal but the tool was largely unstable owing to time constraints and limitations in scope.
